            "In the early stages of cirrhosis, the liver still functions adequately despite the presence of scarring. "
            "It is essential for patients to undergo regular check-ups to monitor liver function and ensure that the disease "
            "does not progress further. Depending on the underlying cause of the cirrhosis, medications such as antiviral treatments "
            "for viral hepatitis or drugs to support alcohol cessation may be recommended. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including "
            "avoiding alcohol, following a balanced diet, and engaging in regular exercise, is crucial to managing the condition. "
            "Additionally, vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, as well as the flu and pneumococcal vaccines, are important to prevent "
            "further complications. Regular blood tests to monitor liver enzyme levels and function are also recommended. While these "
            "measures are important, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider to tailor the treatment plan and ensure that "
            "the disease is managed effectively."

            "At this stage, cirrhosis causes increased pressure within the portal vein, which can lead to complications such as the "
            "formation of varices, or enlarged veins. To manage portal hypertension, medications like beta-blockers may be prescribed "
            "to reduce the pressure and prevent potentially dangerous variceal bleeding. Patients may need to undergo regular endoscopies "
            "to monitor for the presence of esophageal varices. It is critical to avoid alcohol and any substances that could worsen liver "
            "damage. A low-salt diet is recommended to manage fluid retention, and patients should be monitored regularly for any emerging "
            "complications through ultrasounds and blood tests. Due to the complexity of managing portal hypertension, it is highly advised "
            "to maintain close consultation with a healthcare provider, ensuring a personalized treatment plan that may include further interventions."

        "description": (
            "Decompensated cirrhosis represents a more severe form of liver damage, where the liverâ€™s ability to function is compromised. "
            "This stage often brings complications such as ascites, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy, which may require hospitalization "
            "for treatment. Medications such as diuretics can help manage fluid retention, and lactulose or rifaximin may be prescribed to "
            "address hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where the buildup of toxins leads to brain dysfunction. Nutritional support becomes "
            "particularly important, as patients may experience deficiencies; a high-protein, low-sodium diet is typically advised. Depending "
            "on the severity, liver transplantation may be considered, and patients should be evaluated for this option. Because decompensated "
            "cirrhosis carries a high risk of serious complications, it is vital for patients to remain under the care of specialists who can "
            "guide them through treatment options, including potential transplant evaluations."

            "In the final stage of cirrhosis, the liver is no longer able to perform its vital functions, and patients are at risk of multi-organ failure. "
            "At this stage, liver transplantation may be the only potential solution for survival, and patients should be thoroughly evaluated for eligibility. "
            "For those who are not candidates for a transplant, palliative care becomes a central focus. Palliative care aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality "
            "of life, and manage complications such as pain, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, careful management of other organ functions, including "
            "the kidneys, is essential as liver failure can lead to widespread organ dysfunction. Psychological and emotional support are also critical aspects of care "
            "at this stage. Given the complexities involved, patients should work closely with their healthcare team to ensure that they are receiving the most appropriate care."
